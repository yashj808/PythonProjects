# ðŸ§© Shortest Path Finder (Maze Solver with BFS)

This project is a **terminal-based maze solver** built in Python using the **curses** library.  
It shows how to find the shortest path in a maze using the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm, with step-by-step visualization.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Maze visualization directly in the terminal.
- Uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to guarantee the shortest path.
- Shows the path exploration process in real-time.
- Highlights the final path in red.

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- Python **3.8+**
- Works best on **Linux/Mac terminal** or **Windows Terminal with curses support**.

Install curses (only if missing):  
```bash
pip install windows-curses   # for Windows
